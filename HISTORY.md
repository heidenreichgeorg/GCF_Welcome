# This server architecture was started as a C++ server producing HTML in its own while(true) Socket.accept out.println loop
# Until 2018 the server was written in Java and the client pages came as HTML
# In    2019 it was ported to heavy    J2EE with the client still being  HTML
# In    2020 server came back to plain Java but the client was now       JavaScript
# In    2021 the server was ported to NODE JS & the client used it from  JavaScript
# In    2022 server runs NODE JS on Amazon Web Services while client uses JavaScript

# being ported to React
