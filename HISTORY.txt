# This server architecture was started as a C++ server producing HTML in its own while(true) Socket.accept out.println loop
# In 2015 the server was written in Java which produced the client pages as Strings containing HTML
# In 2019 it was ported to heavy J2EE on Apache with the client still being  HTML
# In 2020 the server was migrated back to plain Java but sent data packets to the client which was now using JavaScript
# In 2021 the server was ported to NODE JS which sends the same (huge) JSON packet to the 14 client pages in JavaScript
#         new function: search keyword or account in all historic transactions
#         new function: status page of all accounts and recent transactions
# In 2022 the frontend based on React was added
#         the server runs NODE JS on Amazon Web Services while one client uses JavaScript and another client uses React
