# This server architecture was started as a C++ server producing HTML in its own while(true) Socket.accept out.println loop
# Until 2018 the server was written in Java which produced the client pages as Strings containing HTML
# In    2019 it was ported to heavy    J2EE with the client still being  HTML
# In    2020 the server was migrated back to plain Java but sent data packets to the client which was now using JavaScript
# In    2021 the server was ported to NODE JS which sends the same (huge) JSON packet to the 14 client pages in JavaScript
# In    2022 server runs NODE JS on Amazon Web Services while client uses JavaScript

# being ported to React
